# 🛒 Retail App - Dockerized, Scanned & Signed with Docker Content Trust

This project demonstrates a full DevSecOps workflow for a Spring Boot-based **Retail Web Application**. The app is:
- ✅ Dockerized and tested locally
- 🔍 Scanned using Docker Scout for vulnerabilities
- 🔐 Signed using Docker Content Trust (DCT)
- ☁️ Pushed to DockerHub and pulled on another machine with signature verification

---

## 📦 Prerequisites

- Docker installed
- Maven installed
- DockerHub account
- Docker Scout CLI (`docker scout version`)
- (Optional) Two machines or terminals to test trust enforcement

---

## 🏗️ Build & Run Locally

Clone the Repo
```bash
git clone
````

Change directory
```bash
cd retail-app
````

Build the Spring Boot JAR
```bash
mvn clean install
````

Build Docker image
```bash
docker build -t retail-app:v1 .
````

Test the app locally
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 retail-app:v1
````

Visit: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

---

## ☁️ Push to DockerHub

Login to DockerHub
```bash
docker login
```

Tag the image
```bash
docker tag retail-app:v1 <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

Push the image
```bash
docker push <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

---

## 🔍 Scan with Docker Scout

Quick image summary
```bash
docker scout quickview <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
```bash
docker scout sbom <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

View CVEs (vulnerabilities)
```bash
docker scout cves <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

Recommendations (e.g. upgrade base image)
```bash
docker scout recommendations <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

---

## 🔐 Enable Docker Content Trust (DCT)

### 1️⃣ Generate a Signing Key (first time only)

Windows
```bash
$env:DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST = "1"
```

Linux
```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

```bash
docker trust key generate abhishekkey
```

### 2️⃣ Sign the Image and Push

```bash
docker trust sign <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

```bash
docker push <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```
🔑 You'll be asked to enter strong passphrases for:

* Your root key
* The repository key
* The signer key (abhishekkey)

📝 These keys are stored securely under:
`C:\Users\<YourName>\.docker\trust\private\`

---

## 📥 Pull and Verify Signed Image on Another Machine

Enforce trust (Windows)
```bash
$env:DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST = "1"
```

Enforce trust (Linux)
```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

Pull only if image is signed
```bash
docker pull <dockerhub_username>/retail-app:v1
```

✅ If the image is not signed or tampered with, the pull will **fail**.
